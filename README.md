# Battleship Game in C++
This project is an implementation of the classic Battleship game, built using C++ for a console-based user interface. The game simulates a two-player battle, where each player attempts to sink the opponent's fleet by guessing the locations of their ships on a grid.

## Features
- **Console-based game**: Enjoy the Battleship experience directly from the console.
- **Player vs AI**: The game is designed for a single player to battle against a computer opponent.
- **Random ship placement**: The game randomizes the placement of ships for both the player and the AI to ensure variability.
- **Customizable game grid**: The game features a 10x10 grid for ship placement.
- **Graphical enhancements**: Custom color outputs for an enhanced console experience.
- **Background music support**: The game comes with background music to add an immersive experience (optional).

## Gameplay
Each player has a fleet of ships that are hidden from their opponent. Players take turns guessing coordinates on their opponentâ€™s grid to try and locate and sink their ships. The game continues until all of one player's ships are sunk.

### Ships
The following types of ships are available in the game:
- **Aircraft Carrier**: Occupies 5 cells.
- **Battleship**: Occupies 4 cells.
- **Submarine**: Occupies 3 cells.
- **Cruiser**: Occupies 3 cells.
- **Destroyer**: Occupies 2 cells.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **C++ Compiler**: You need a C++ compiler that supports C++11 or higher.
- **Audio libraries**: To enable background music, ensure you have the necessary audio libraries (like SFML or other alternatives) installed.
